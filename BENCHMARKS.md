# Benchmarks ðŸ”‹

This file contains some benchmarks using this library. You should not see these
benchmarks as a speed comparison. Instead, see the benchmarks as part of the
added overhead of this library.

Take this things into consideration when running/interpreting these benchmarks
yourself:

- [Deno bench warms up](https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/17649#issuecomment-1416761766)
- Node/Bun tests might take some time to be recorded here.
- All tests used the exact same database container in `localhost`.

The numbers here may vary from computer to computer, from network to network.
Don't take these numers for granted. No guarantees are given.

These benchmarks are run with `deno bench` are are present in the `tests/`
directory. You may interpret them in the following way:

- benchmark: The name of the benchmark function.
- time (avg): The average time of the benchmark.
- iter/s: The number of iterations per second.
- (minâ€¦max): The minimum and maximum time of the benchmark.
- p75, p99, p995: The 75th, 99th, and 99.5th percentile of the benchmark.
  - p75: The 75th percentile of the benchmark. This means that the 75% of the
    execution times are less or equal to this value.
  - p99: The 99th percentile of the benchmark. This means that the 99% of the
    execution times are less or equal to this value.
  - p995: The 99.5th percentile of the benchmark. This means that the 99.5% of
