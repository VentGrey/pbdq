# pbdq - PocketBase Deno Qwrapper ðŸ¦•ðŸ“š

> Qwrapper means Query Wrapper (?)

## Introduction ðŸ‘€

Ppd (or pbdq) is a TypeScript wrapper for the [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io) database. As the official SDK was not
meant to be used in server side TS, I created this wrapper to make it easier to use the PocketBase SDK in the server.
This should allow you to write a middle server that can act as a load balancer, monitor, observability node, etc over
a given PocketBase instance.

Any issues you find here, please open an issue and don't blame the PocketBase team with issues present here (which)
are not related to the SDK directly.

This wrapper is meant to be used with Deno, however, since the only dependency is `npm:pocketbase`, and it's deployed
via `JSR` you should be able to use it in any other environment. Be aware that I created this for my own purposes and
will consider my own use cases. I'm open to patches that follow the Python zen: _Special cases are not special enough to break the rules_.

## Features ðŸŒŸ

- Portable between JS environments thanks to JSR
- In sync with latest PocketBase JS-SDK verion
- Deno first
- No complex type-gymnastics.
- (WIP) Fully docummented and tested in production.

## Installation ðŸ“¦

WIP - Still polishing some things until it works just enough to be published in JSR.

## Basic Usage ðŸŽ‰

In this example we are using TypeScript and PocketBase to get a list of products
from the `products` collection. This assumes you already have type for
`Product` in your project.

```typescript
import Client, { ListResult } from "pocketbase";
import PocketBase from "pocketbase";

import { Pbd } from "pbd";

import type { Product } from "./types";

const pb: Client = new PocketBase("http://localhost:8090");
const pbd: Pbd = new Pbd({ client: pb });

// To get a list of products
const products = await pbd.getList<Product>({
    collectionName: "products"
});

// If you want to change the page and the number of items returned per
// page you can use the optional parameters.  
const products = await pbd.getList<Product>({
        collectionName: "products",
        page: 1,
        perPage: 10
});
   
// PocketBase options are also available if you need them:
const products = await pbd.getList<Product>({
    collectionName: "products",
    options: { sort: "-created" }
});
```
