# PBDQ Code of Conduct

## Purpose

GitHub whines on a tab if I don't add a Code of Conduct.

## Our Standards

### Contributions

1. **Relevance:** Contributions should be relevant to the project and its goals.
   Non-code-related topics, such as personal beliefs, political views, or other
   unrelated matters, are not relevant to the project and should not be
   discussed.
2. **Professionalism:** Interactions should remain professional and focused on
   the project. Disagreements and discussions should be about code and technical
   matters ONLY. This ain't a nursery.

### Unacceptable Behavior

1. **Off-topic Discussions:** Avoid discussions that are not related to the
   project, such as politics, personal beliefs, or other non-technical issues.
2. **Disrespect:** I don't get mad if you call me an idiot, as long as you
   justify your statement with an argument.
3. **Discrimination:** Any form of discrimination based on personal attributes
   or beliefs is unacceptable. Focus on code and technical matters only.

## Enforcement

Don't be an idiot and that's all. I welcome criticism and complaints as long as
they come with reasoning behind them. Any other form of enforcement will be
dealt with by the project maintainers. (me xD)

## Reporting

If you encounter any issues or have concerns about this Code of Conduct, please
contact the project maintainers.
